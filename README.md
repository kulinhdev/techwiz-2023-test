Here is one way to format that Markdown content to make it more readable:

# Laravel + ReactJS Project Setup

## Prerequisites

- PHP >= 8.2
- Composer = 2.6
- Node & NPM = 18.14.0/9.3.1
- MySQL = 8.0.32

## Laravel Setup

### Installation

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update your app settings and database credentials
- Generate app key using `php artisan key:generate`

- Install Laravel dependencies
  ```bash
  composer install
  ```

- Run database migrations
  ```bash 
  php artisan migrate
  ```

- Start local dev server
  ```bash
  php artisan serve
  ```

## React Setup

- Open React folder
  ```bash
  cd reactjs
  ```

- Install React dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Start frontend dev server
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- Configure React to proxy API requests to Laravel backend

- Build React assets for production
  ```bash 
  npm run build
  ```

Now you can access the Laravel app at http://localhost:8000 and the React app at http://localhost:3000.

## Production Deployment

- Configure caches, sessions, queues, etc for production
- Build React assets for production  
- Optimize Composer autoloading

The key changes:

- Added headings and sub-headings 
- Grouped related content together
- Formatted code blocks for readability
- Added some whitespace between sections

Let me know if you would like me to further refine the formatting!
